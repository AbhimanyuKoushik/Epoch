"""
The algorithm goes by following the steps -->
1. Apply Kmeans clustering to all the points
2. If a cluster has less than min_threshold points consider them as noise
3. If a cluster has more than max_threshold points, recursive apply Kmeans to each cluster 
        until every cluster has less than 55 points
4. Now take any four random points in a given cluster and find average distance, do that for every cluster and take average of all.
        Let it be avgdist
5. If the cluster's average distance is more than N times avgdist consider them as noise
6. Merge clusters based on distance between centroids (smallest ones (based on number of points) first).
        A cluster always merges with cluster whose centroids is nearest.
7. This merging happens till the number of clusters is the given amount not more not less
